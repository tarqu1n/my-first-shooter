## Notes
- All attack animations should be exactly 1 second long so they can be modified by a `attackSpeed` (attacks per second) multiplier.

## TODO:
- Knockback for enemies hit by melee
- Recalculate AI grid for dynamically added items: https://arongranberg.com/astar/docs/graphupdates.html#recalculate-whole-graph
- Raycast the click event to fire projectile
